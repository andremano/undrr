        - [ ] It requires clear skies to function effectively.
        - [ ] It is limited to short-range observations only.

        # Point Cloud Data

        How is point cloud data generally collected?

        - [ ] By manually measuring distances on a map.
        - [x] Using LIDAR or other scanning technologies.
        - [ ] By analyzing photographs.
        - [ ] Through statistical surveys.

        # Topographic Maps
